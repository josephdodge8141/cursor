# Understanding Context in Cursor

This directory explores the concept of context in Cursor - one of the most important aspects of working effectively with AI-powered coding tools.

## What is Context?

Context in Cursor refers to the "working memory" that the AI uses to understand your code and provide relevant responses. It includes:

- Code you've shared
- Previous messages in your conversation
- Files you've added to the chat
- Project structure and settings

## Key Concepts About Context

### Tokens and Context Windows

- **Tokens**: Context is measured in tokens, with each token representing approximately 4 characters
- **Context Window**: Each AI model has a maximum context window (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet has a 200K token context window)
- **Token Usage**: You can measure tokens using the [Anthropic Tokenizer](https://lunary.ai/anthropic-tokenizer)

### Types of Context

1. **Intent Context**: Tells the AI what to do and how to do it
   - Your queries and instructions
   - Cursor Rules that guide AI behavior

2. **State Context**: Describes the current state of your codebase
   - Attached files
   - Error logs
   - Previous code snippets

### Context Management

- Cursor's context management is not a simple FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer
- Cursor uses custom logic to decide what context to keep and what to remove
- More recent information generally takes priority over older information

## Exercises

Use the files in this directory to practice working with context:

1. **Context Size Experiments**:
   - Open the empty `context.js` file
   - Try adding increasingly complex code snippets to see how tokens are used
   - Notice how the AI's understanding changes as context grows

2. **Context Management**:
   - Use the `prompt.txt` file to add specific instructions
   - Observe how the AI prioritizes different types of context

## Best Practices for Managing Context

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, concise instructions to make the most of your token usage
2. **Share Relevant Code**: Only include code that's directly relevant to your query
3. **Use @mentions**: Use @ to specifically include important files or directories
4. **Clear Context When Needed**: Start a new chat when switching to a completely different task

Understanding how context works will help you get more accurate and relevant responses from Cursor's AI features.
