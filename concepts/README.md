# Cursor Concepts

This directory explores the foundational concepts that power Cursor's AI capabilities. Understanding these concepts will help you use Cursor more effectively and get the most out of its features.

## Concept Overview

### Context
Learn how Cursor manages and uses context to provide relevant AI responses:
- What context is and how it's measured in tokens
- How chat history is managed
- Different types of context (intent context vs. state context)
- How to optimize your context usage for better results

### Models
Understand the AI models that power Cursor:
- Different models available (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- Context windows and token limits
- Output capabilities
- Strengths and weaknesses of each model
- Cost considerations

### Cursor Rules
Learn about Cursor's rule system:
- User rules that apply across all projects
- Project rules that are specific to individual codebases
- How rules are created (automatic, manual, agent-applied)
- How to leverage rules for more consistent and accurate AI assistance

### MCP (Model Control Protocol)
Explore the underlying protocol that powers Cursor's AI interactions:
- How Cursor communicates with AI models
- The structure of MCP
- Advanced usage patterns

## Directory Structure

Each subdirectory contains detailed information and exercises to help you understand these concepts:

- **context/**: Explore how context works in Cursor
- **models/**: Learn about the different AI models available
- **cursor_rules/**: Understand how to use and create rules
- **mcp/**: Dive into the Model Control Protocol

## Getting Started

Start by exploring the context directory, as understanding context is fundamental to effective use of Cursor. Then, learn about the different models available and how to choose the right one for your tasks. Finally, explore rules and MCP for more advanced usage.
