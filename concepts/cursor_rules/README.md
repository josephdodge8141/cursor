# Understanding Cursor Rules

This directory explores Cursor Rules, a powerful feature that helps guide AI behavior to produce more consistent, higher-quality code that matches your project's standards and patterns.

## What are Cursor Rules?

Cursor Rules are instructions that guide how the AI generates and modifies code. They help ensure that AI-generated code follows your project's conventions, best practices, and patterns.

## Types of Cursor Rules

### User Rules
- Apply across all your projects
- Set general preferences for coding style and conventions

### Project Rules
- Specific to a particular codebase
- Can be created in several ways:
  - **Automatic**: Inferred automatically from your codebase
  - **Manual**: Written directly by you
  - **Agent Applied**: Generated by the AI based on patterns it observes
  - **Manually Applied**: Rules you review and approve before they're used

## Rule Application Methods

Rules can be applied in different ways:

1. **Always**: Rules that are always applied to every interaction
2. **Manual**: Rules you manually attach to specific conversations
3. **Auto Attached**: Rules that automatically apply when working with matching files
4. **Agent Requested**: Rules the AI can request to apply when it identifies a need

## Exercises

Use the files in this directory to practice working with Cursor Rules:

1. **Basic Rule Testing**:
   - Open `cursor_rules.js`
   - Follow the instructions in `prompt.txt` to experiment with different rule types
   - Observe how different rules affect the code that's generated

2. **Rule Creation and Modification**:
   - Try creating your own rules using the Command Palette (âŒ˜+P)
   - Experiment with different rule types and application methods
   - See how specific rules change the AI's behavior

## Example Rule Workflow

1. Start with no rules and request a function to reverse a string
2. Add a function naming rule and request the same function
3. Change rule application methods and observe differences
4. Create agent-requested rules for specific use cases
5. Set up "always" rules for consistent code standards

## Benefits of Using Rules

- More consistent code quality
- Automatic adherence to project conventions
- Reduced need for manual corrections
- Faster onboarding to project-specific patterns
- Better integration of AI-generated code with existing codebases

Mastering Cursor Rules will significantly improve your productivity by ensuring AI-generated code matches your preferences and project requirements without constant manual guidance.
