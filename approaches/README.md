# Development Approaches with Cursor

This directory explores different software development methodologies and how Cursor's AI capabilities can enhance and streamline each approach.

## Development Methodologies

### Prototyping
Learn how to quickly generate functional code prototypes using Cursor:
- Rapidly create new applications and features
- Explore different implementation possibilities
- Quickly test ideas and concepts
- Turn sketches and ideas into working code

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Discover how Cursor can accelerate the TDD workflow:
- Pass existing tests as context to generate functional code
- Let Cursor automatically identify test files through search
- Have Cursor implement functionality based on test requirements
- Use Auto-Run to automatically test and refine implementations

### Refactoring
Learn how Cursor can assist with code improvement:
- Use plain English to describe desired code improvements
- Refactor complex methods into more maintainable code
- Improve code quality without changing functionality
- Update code to follow best practices and patterns

### TDD with Refactoring
Combine Test-Driven Development with refactoring:
- Start with tests, implement functionality, then refactor
- Ensure code remains functional while improving readability
- Maintain test coverage during refactoring
- Iteratively improve your codebase

## Directory Structure

Each subdirectory contains examples and exercises for a specific development approach:

- **prototyping/**: Examples of using Cursor for rapid application development
- **tdd/**: Exercises for implementing Test-Driven Development with Cursor
- **refactoring/**: Code samples for practicing refactoring with Cursor
- **tdd_refactor/**: Combined exercises demonstrating TDD followed by refactoring

## Getting Started

1. Start with the **prototyping** directory to learn how to quickly generate functional code
2. Move on to the **tdd** directory to practice Test-Driven Development
3. Explore the **refactoring** directory to improve existing code
4. Finish with the **tdd_refactor** directory to combine these approaches

Each subdirectory contains its own README with specific instructions and examples.
