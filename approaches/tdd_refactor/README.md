# TDD with Refactoring in Cursor

This directory demonstrates how to combine Test-Driven Development (TDD) with refactoring using Cursor's AI capabilities, creating a powerful workflow for developing high-quality, maintainable code.

## What is TDD with Refactoring?

This combined approach follows these steps:
1. Write tests that define the expected behavior
2. Implement code that passes the tests
3. Refactor the code to improve design while maintaining functionality
4. Verify that tests still pass after refactoring

## How Cursor Enhances TDD with Refactoring

Cursor helps with every stage of this workflow:
- Creating comprehensive tests based on requirements
- Implementing code that passes those tests
- Identifying opportunities for refactoring
- Suggesting and implementing cleaner code structures
- Running tests to verify that functionality is preserved

## Exercise: Test, Implement, and Refactor

In this directory, you'll find a JavaScript file with existing code that needs testing and refactoring:

1. **Creating Tests**:
   - The first task is to create tests for the existing `tdd_refactor.js` file
   - Cursor will help you write comprehensive tests in `tdd_refactor_test.js`

2. **Understanding the Code**:
   - Once tests are in place, Cursor will explain what the code does in plain English
   - This understanding is crucial before refactoring

3. **Refactoring Process**:
   - Cursor will help break down complex methods into smaller, more focused ones
   - The refactored code will maintain the same functionality but be more maintainable

4. **Verification**:
   - Run tests again to ensure the refactored code still works correctly
   - Cursor will automatically run tests and make adjustments if needed

## How to Use

1. Open `tdd_refactor.js` to understand the existing code
2. Open the Agent interface with âŒ˜+K (or Ctrl+K)
3. Use the prompt from `prompt.txt` to instruct Cursor to:
   - Create tests
   - Analyze the code
   - Refactor it
4. Review the generated tests and refactored code
5. Run the tests to verify everything works as expected

## Benefits of the Combined Approach

- **Confidence in Refactoring**: Tests provide a safety net for refactoring
- **Improved Code Quality**: Start with working code and systematically improve it
- **Better Understanding**: The process forces deeper understanding of the code
- **Continuous Improvement**: Establish a cycle of testing, implementing, and refactoring
- **Maintainable Codebase**: End up with code that is both functional and maintainable

This combined approach leverages the strengths of both TDD and refactoring, using Cursor to make the process faster and more effective.
