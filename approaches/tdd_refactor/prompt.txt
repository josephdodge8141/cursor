Using testUtils.js write a comprehensive test file to test the functionality of tdd_refactor.js. Make sure to put this test in tdd_refactor_test.js. Once these tests are passing, explain in plain english what this transaction method actually accomplishes. Finally, re-factor the method to use much smaller methods that are split intuitively. Run the test file to verify that your re-factor was successful.
