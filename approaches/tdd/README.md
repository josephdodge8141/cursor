# Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Cursor

This directory demonstrates how to use Cursor's AI capabilities to enhance the Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow, allowing you to implement functionality that satisfies test requirements more efficiently.

## What is Test-Driven Development?

Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code:
1. Write a failing test for a specific requirement
2. Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code while ensuring tests continue to pass

## How Cursor Enhances TDD

Cursor can dramatically improve the TDD workflow by:
- Automatically understanding test requirements
- Generating code that satisfies test criteria
- Running tests and fixing issues in a single workflow
- Learning from your codebase patterns to match existing style

## Exercise: Implementing a User Service

In this directory, you'll find files to practice TDD with Cursor:

1. **Understand the Tests**:
   - Open `tdd_test.js` to review the test cases
   - Understand what functionality your implementation needs to satisfy

2. **Implementation Process**:
   - Use the prompt in `prompt.txt` to instruct Cursor to implement the code
   - Watch as Cursor:
     - Analyzes the test requirements
     - Implements the necessary functions in `tdd.js`
     - Runs tests to verify the implementation
     - Makes adjustments if tests fail

3. **Review and Learning**:
   - Examine the generated implementation in `tdd.js`
   - Understand how it satisfies each test case
   - Try modifying the tests to see how Cursor adapts the implementation

## How to Use

1. Open `tdd_test.js` to understand the requirements
2. Open the Agent interface with âŒ˜+K (or Ctrl+K)
3. Use the prompt from `prompt.txt` or create your own instruction
4. Allow Cursor to implement the code and run tests
5. Review the generated solution in `tdd.js`

## Tips for Effective TDD with Cursor

- Ensure your tests are clear and specific
- Include edge cases in your tests
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Enable Auto-Run to let Cursor automatically test and refine implementations
- Start with simpler test cases and gradually add complexity

## Benefits of TDD with Cursor

- Faster implementation of tested functionality
- Higher code quality from the start
- Reduced debugging time
- Consistent adherence to test requirements
- Learning from existing test patterns

Test-Driven Development with Cursor combines the reliability of TDD with the speed and efficiency of AI assistance.
