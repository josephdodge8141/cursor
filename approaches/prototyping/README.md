# Prototyping with Cursor

This directory demonstrates how to use Cursor for rapid prototyping and idea exploration. Prototyping is an essential part of the development process that allows you to quickly test concepts before investing in full development.

## What is Prototyping?

Prototyping is the process of quickly creating a functional version of an application or feature to:
- Test feasibility of concepts
- Gather early feedback
- Explore technical approaches
- Validate ideas before committing to full development

## How Cursor Enhances Prototyping

Cursor's AI capabilities significantly speed up the prototyping process by:
- Generating complete code structures from high-level descriptions
- Creating functional components based on requirements
- Suggesting implementation approaches
- Filling in boilerplate code automatically

## Exercise: Job Board Prototype

In this directory, you'll find resources to practice prototyping a job board application:

1. **Requirements Analysis**:
   - The `tickets.txt` file contains user stories and requirements for a job board
   - Review these to understand what needs to be prototyped

2. **Prototyping Process**:
   - Use the prompt in `prompt.txt` to instruct Cursor to create a prototype
   - Watch as Cursor generates files in the `prototyping_project/` directory
   - Observe how it translates requirements into functional code

3. **Review and Iteration**:
   - Examine the generated prototype
   - Try modifying the requirements in `tickets.txt`
   - Ask Cursor to update specific parts of the prototype

## How to Use

1. Open the `prompt.txt` file in Cursor
2. Use âŒ˜+K (or Ctrl+K) to open the Agent interface
3. Allow Cursor to process the prompt and create prototype files
4. Review the generated files in the `prototyping_project/` directory
5. Iterate by modifying requirements and generating new code

## Tips for Effective Prototyping with Cursor

- Start with clear, concise requirements
- Break down complex features into smaller components
- Be specific about technologies you want to use
- Provide examples or references when available
- Iterate frequently, refining the prototype based on feedback

Prototyping with Cursor allows you to quickly transform ideas into working code, dramatically reducing the time from concept to demonstration.
