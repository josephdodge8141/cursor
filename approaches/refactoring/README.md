# Refactoring with Cursor

This directory demonstrates how to use Cursor to refactor existing code, making it more maintainable, readable, and efficient without changing its functionality.

## What is Refactoring?

Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. The goals of refactoring include:
- Improving code readability
- Reducing complexity
- Enhancing maintainability
- Making code more testable
- Eliminating code smells

## How Cursor Enhances Refactoring

Cursor's AI capabilities make refactoring faster and more effective by:
- Understanding complex code quickly
- Suggesting appropriate refactoring patterns
- Implementing changes across multiple files when needed
- Maintaining functionality while improving structure
- Providing explanations for refactoring decisions

## Exercise: Refactoring Complex Functions

In this directory, you'll find a JavaScript file with a complex function that needs refactoring:

1. **Analyze the Existing Code**:
   - Open `refactoring.js` to review the code
   - Identify areas that could benefit from refactoring

2. **Refactoring Process**:
   - Use the prompt in `prompt.txt` to instruct Cursor to refactor the code
   - Watch as Cursor splits a complex function into smaller, more focused functions
   - Observe how the refactored code maintains the same functionality

3. **Review and Learning**:
   - Compare the original and refactored code
   - Understand how the refactored version improves readability and maintainability
   - Try creating your own refactoring prompts for other parts of the code

## How to Use

1. Open `refactoring.js` to understand the original code
2. Open the Agent interface with âŒ˜+K (or Ctrl+K)
3. Use the prompt from `prompt.txt` or create your own refactoring instructions
4. Allow Cursor to refactor the code
5. Review the refactored solution

## Common Refactoring Patterns to Try with Cursor

- **Extract Function**: Split large functions into smaller, focused ones
- **Rename Variable/Function**: Improve naming for better understanding
- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: Convert complex conditionals to cleaner OOP patterns
- **Introduce Parameter Object**: Group related parameters together
- **Extract Class**: Move related functions and data into their own class

## Benefits of Refactoring with Cursor

- Faster implementation of complex refactoring patterns
- Consistent application of best practices
- Reduced risk of introducing bugs during refactoring
- Educational insights into better code design
- Ability to handle large-scale refactoring projects efficiently

Refactoring with Cursor allows you to continuously improve your codebase without the usual time investment and risk.
