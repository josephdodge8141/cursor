# Agent Capabilities in Cursor

This directory contains exercises to help you understand and practice Cursor's powerful Agent capabilities, which allow you to accomplish complex coding tasks with AI assistance.

## What is the Agent?

The Agent feature in Cursor is an AI-powered assistant that can:
- Write code based on your instructions
- Execute terminal commands safely
- Automatically run and test code
- Search the web for relevant documentation and solutions

## Exercises

In this directory, you'll find a JavaScript file (`agent.js`) and a prompt file (`prompt.txt`) that guide you through using the Agent to modify and improve code:

1. **Function Modification**:
   - Open `agent.js` to see a simple greeting function
   - Follow the instructions in `prompt.txt` to modify the function:
     - Add a new parameter for time of day
     - Update the function behavior
     - Run tests to verify your changes
   - Watch as the Agent helps you implement and test these changes

## How to Use

1. Open `agent.js` in Cursor
2. Open the Agent interface (⌘+K or Ctrl+K)
3. Paste the contents of `prompt.txt` or type your own instructions
4. Observe how the Agent:
   - Analyzes the existing code
   - Proposes changes
   - Executes commands to test the changes
   - Makes adjustments based on test results

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **⌘+K** (or Ctrl+K): Open the inline code editor/Agent interface
- **⌘+/** (or Ctrl+/): Open chat window
- **⌘+Enter** (or Ctrl+Enter): Run code without saving

## Advanced Agent Features to Try

- **Auto-Run**: Enable this feature to have the Agent automatically run commands and tests
- **Web Search**: Ask the Agent to search for documentation or solutions online
- **Refactoring**: Try asking the Agent to refactor the code to be more efficient or readable
- **Terminal Commands**: Have the Agent run terminal commands to set up dependencies or run tests

The Agent is particularly powerful for tasks that require multiple steps or iterations, as it can handle the entire workflow from writing code to testing and refining it.
