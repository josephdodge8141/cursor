# Tab Completion in Cursor

This directory contains exercises to help you understand and practice Cursor's powerful tab completion functionality.

## What is Tab Completion?

Tab completion in Cursor is an AI-powered feature that helps you write code faster by suggesting completions as you type. It goes beyond traditional autocomplete by understanding context and suggesting multi-line code blocks.

## Exercises

In this directory, you'll find an example JavaScript file (`tab.js`) that you can use to practice different types of tab completion:

1. **Basic Auto-complete**: Try typing the beginning of a JavaScript function or variable and press Tab to see suggestions.

2. **Multi-line Auto-complete**: When working with the incomplete functions and objects, try triggering multi-line completion to fill in complex code blocks.

3. **Partial Accepts**: Notice the incomplete `buttonStyles` object and `userText` variable. Try using Tab to generate completions and practice accepting only parts of the suggestions using:
   - Tab to accept the entire suggestion
   - Right arrow to accept one word
   - Ctrl+Right arrow (or Cmd+Right arrow on Mac) to accept more text

## How to Use

1. Open `tab.js` in Cursor
2. Position your cursor at various incomplete sections of the code
3. Press Tab to trigger completion
4. Practice accepting full completions or partial completions
5. Notice how Cursor learns from the existing code patterns in the file

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **âŒ˜+k** (or Ctrl+k): Open the inline code editor
- **Tab**: Accept the entire suggestion
- **Right arrow**: Accept one word of the suggestion
- **Ctrl+Right arrow** (or **Cmd+Right arrow** on Mac): Accept more text

Experiment with these shortcuts to find the workflow that best suits your coding style.
