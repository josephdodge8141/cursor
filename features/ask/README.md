# Ask Functionality in Cursor

This directory contains exercises to help you understand and practice Cursor's Ask functionality, which allows you to get explanations and insights about code.

## What is Ask?

The Ask feature in Cursor allows you to select code and ask questions about it, helping you understand complex code, learn about niche programming concepts, and gain insights into how code works.

## Exercises

In this directory, you'll find example files that you can use to practice the Ask functionality:

1. **Code Explanation (ask.js)**: 
   - Open the JavaScript file
   - Select a portion of code you want to understand
   - Use the Ask feature to get an explanation of what the code does
   - Use the prompt in `prompt.txt` to get a detailed explanation of both what the code does and what JavaScript is doing behind the scenes

2. **SQL Understanding (ask2.sql)**:
   - Open the SQL file
   - Select complex queries
   - Use Ask to understand what the queries are doing and how they work
   - Follow the prompts in `prompt2.txt` to get specific explanations about SQL concepts

## How to Use

1. Open one of the example files in Cursor
2. Select a section of code you want to understand
3. Press **⌘+L** (or Ctrl+L) to add the selected code to the chat window
4. Type your question about the code or use one of the prompts from the prompt files
5. Press Enter to get an explanation

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **⌘+L** (or Ctrl+L): Add selected code to the chat window
- **⌘+/** (or Ctrl+/): Open chat window
- **@**: Manually include specific folders/files/functions in your question for more context

## Tips for Better Explanations

- Be specific in your questions
- Select only the relevant code sections
- Include context about what you're trying to accomplish
- Ask follow-up questions to clarify anything you don't understand

The Ask functionality is particularly useful when learning new codebases or technologies, as it can help you quickly understand unfamiliar code patterns and concepts.
